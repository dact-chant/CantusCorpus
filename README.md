# CantusCorpus dataset

This is a repository for versions of CantusCorpus dataset.

The data for versions of the dataset, and the corresponding code for building the dataset, are available in individual releases.
(The chants.csv file is over 200 MB, so it is something we do not necessarily want in git and in principle it is only versioned
once per version of the dataset, so there is no history lost.)

Each version of the dataset has its own descriptive README.
  
Each version of the dataset also has its own license under which it is released, and it can be assumed that it will continue to adhere to CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.  
  
CantusCorpus is being maintained under the Digital Analysis of Chant Transmission ([DACT](https://dact-chant.ca/)). This project, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, aims to advance the study of chant dissemination using computational tools.
